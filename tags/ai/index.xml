      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over coffee with Ritendra, VP of AI at Eightfold, our conversation turned to how teams actually build AI today. Ritendra, a recognized leader in the AI space, has shaped teams of all sizes—from small pods to over 200 engineers and researchers—at Google, Facebook, Databricks, and Xerox PARC, gives him a unique and rare perspective on what works and what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His take was refreshingly simple: all of AI development can be seen through two lenses—Fast AI and Slow AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-real-challenge-in-building-ai-agents-isnt-the-ai---its-everything-else&#34;&gt;The Real Challenge in Building AI Agents Isn&amp;rsquo;t the AI - It&amp;rsquo;s Everything Else&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AI industry has a marketing problem. We’ve become so infatuated with the &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo; in artificial intelligence that we’ve forgotten the most important truth about building agentic AI systems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90% of the work is software engineering, and only 10% is actually about the AI model itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a hot take - it’s a hard-learned lesson from intense 11 months of building AI interview and agentic systems at Eightfold AI, where this realisation became both the problem statement and a career pivot. While everyone’s debating which foundation model has the highest benchmark scores, the real battles are being fought in error handling, state management, and API integrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
